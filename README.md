# Multiple Boolean Evaluator Visualization

This custom viz allows you to evaluate/combine multiple boolean values as a result of comparing each NRQL query result to its specified threshold.

For example, you have the following queries and thresholds to compare it to:

| NRQL                            | Threshold     | NRQL Result <= Threshold?   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------|
| SELECT average(`apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization`) FROM Metric WHERE appName = 'Promo Service'                          | 30            | false                       |
| SELECT average(`apm.service.datastore.duration`) FROM Metric WHERE appName = 'Inventory Service'                          | 10            | true                        |

Evaluating/combining the outputs above (which are `false` AND `true`) will produce a final result of `false`. If both are `true`, then the final result will also be `true`.
